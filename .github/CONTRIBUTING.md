# Contributing

**First off, we ðŸ’– community contributions**

## Where do I start?

Start by checking if the bug or feature is already documented in the project
[**Issues**](https://github.com/mobify/redux-runtypes-schema/issues). If
you find one, feel free to add a comment with your specific details. Any
extra bit of information helps!

If you didn't find an Issue, create one. Provide as many details as possible,
including proposed design/code changes (if you have some in mind already).

We'd be happy to discuss your idea and help get you started. This will ensure
that your idea fits with the spirit of the project before you invest a bunch of
time building it out.

Once you have a solid idea of what you're going to do, open a **Pull Request**
and fill it out as thoroughly as possible. A well-written PR will go a long way
to getting other people's help to get your PR merged! :D

## Coding Conventions

We follow the "keep with the spirit of existing source" model for coding
conventions. Basically, follow the format and conventions of existing code.
